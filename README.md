## **Technical Changes Made to Prompt Template:**

### **1. Modified GENERAL BEHAVIOUR Section:**
**Changed:**
```python
• If the user's question is not healthcare-related, aesthetics and body related, respond: "The topic is outside my expertise."
```
**To:**
```python
• If the user's question is completely unrelated to healthcare, aesthetics, body treatments, or medical procedures, respond: "The topic is outside my expertise."
```

### **2. Added New Section:**
```python
CONVERSATION CONTEXT AWARENESS
- Maintain awareness of previously discussed services in the conversation
- When users ask follow-up questions that reference previous topics, understand the context and connect it to earlier mentioned procedures
- Always treat questions about procedure combinations, scheduling, or treatment planning as within your expertise when they relate to aesthetic services
```

### **3. Enhanced ANALYZE QUESTION Step:**
**Added these lines to step 1:**
```python
- Consider context from previous questions in the conversation
- Questions about combining treatments, scheduling, or timing are within scope if they relate to aesthetic procedures
- If the question is completely unrelated to healthcare/aesthetics, respond: "The topic is outside my expertise."
```

### **Summary:**
- **1 line modified** in GENERAL BEHAVIOUR
- **1 new section added** (CONVERSATION CONTEXT AWARENESS)  
- **3 lines added** to ANALYZE QUESTION step

**Purpose:** Fix issue where AI incorrectly responds "outside my expertise" to valid follow-up questions about combining aesthetic procedures.
